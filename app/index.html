      <h2>Not Just a Trilogy</h2>
      <div class="row">
        <p><b>Phase 1:</b></p>
        <p>I was born and raised in Iowa.  I graduated from Kirkwood Community College with a two-year degree in LAN Management.  During this time, a trip starting in Cancun, Mexico and then sidetracking to Belize and Guatemala with a friend, changed my life forever.  This was the spark that led me to an additional trip from Mexico all the way to Panama and Peru.  I also had several other trips.  One in particular, Hawaii, took me down a long 10 year journey.</p>

        <p><b>Phase 2:</b></p>
        <p>Before graduating and moving from Iowa to Hawaii. I started to study Japanese.  I decided to continue my education in Oahu which was the most Japanese like place I had ever seen.  I worked in a Japanese Restaurant until I could get in-state residency.  Upon becoming a student again, a little way into my degree I was awarded the Honda Scholarship to study in Osaka, Japan for a year.  The time in Japan was by far the most rewarding thing in my life.  On arrival back to Hawaii, as I was finishing school, an old friend contacted me with an invite to a school that he worked at in Bangkok, Thailand.</p>
      
        <p><b>Phase 3:</b></p>
        <p>I moved out to Thailand and all in all spent about 6 years teaching English to students ranging from Kindergarten to Middle School.  Being involved in the educational system proved to be very rewarding for me, and during this time I consistently tried to enrich myself with studying the Thai language and being immersed in the international melting pot known as Bangkok.</p>
        
        <p><b>Final Phase:</b></p>
        <p>I chose to move to Atlanta because a lot of my family lives here now.  However, this was challenging for me because I was unsure of what to do for work and how to spend my free time.  I started to study for a Cisco Certification until I heard about the Iron Yard.  I spent a little over a month prepping for this intensive course which proved to be the most challenging thing I have ever done. The course pushed me to my limit, and I came out stronger because it.  During this time I have absolutely fallen in love with JavaScript and its many related technologies.  Being able to build and create things is a truly self-gratifying experience. Although I love Asia, being close to my family is important.  Now that I have found my passion, I will limit the traveling to a few weeks a year and focus on building a career.</p>

          <p>As a developer we are often tasked with creating a website from an image provided to us from a designer.  During the first week of school at The Iron Yard, we were assigned this task using HTML, CSS, Sip, and the Perfect Pixel tool.  Getting things to line up just right was surprisingly challenging and time consuming, and it gave me a new appreciation for websites.</p>

          <a href="https://bee-calculator.surge.sh/" target="_blank"><img class="icon" src="images/bee.png" alt="Icon"></a>
          <p>During the second week we began to learn JavaScript, and in particular for this assignment we were learning the basics of working with the DOM.  This simple calculator can add, subtract, multiply, and divide whole numbers.  Figuring out the logic in making a calculator work was exhilarating and was my first step into real programming.</p>

          <p>In week three we continued to work with creating a website based on an image; however in this case we also used jQuery for DOM manipulation.  We used Ajax with JSON objects to pull in live data from the Etsy API to populate our site.  When the live data finally came in, I was able to dig deep into the JSON data and pull out what I needed.  It was a great feeling of accomplishment.</p>

          <p>Our first major group project was in week four.  We were given a write-up from a client detailing what they were looking for in the creation of their website.  As well as learning all of the technical skills such as collaborating on Git and dealing with Flickr's Photo API, the project required the element of working as a team and learning how to divide up modular pieces of work so that everyone could contribute.</p>

          <p>Moving on to week six, we built a couple of simple contact lists using Backbone and React.  In this project we were tasked with creating an Instagram-like clone.  We used Backbone to make Models, Collections, and Routes for the application.  We used React to write all of the components.  In this application users can add and edit images stored in the Parse database.  This was one of the more taxing times for me in the course; we went from using only a few files for making a website into using many files to build a modular application.</p>

          <p>At the end of week seven we were assigned our second group project.  This was our first project to work with a few Back-end students to set up a login and perform the CRUD operations.  Our task was to create a flashcard game to help users study.  Users can add decks and cards based on any topics that they select.  In this project we used Backbone and React to set up different Routes for our application.  Learning how to communicate with the Back End students and furthering my knowledge of Backbone and React made this a project I will never forget.</p>

          <p>In week eight we had our first major Angular application requiring us to handle all of the CRUD procedures from start to finish.  We used controllers, services, routers, and many of Angular's built in directives to do this.  We also worked with the Parse database to store changes to the images and data on the site.  After gaining experience working with larger applications in Backbone and React, learning Angular seem more manageable for me.  I started to see how frameworks function.</p>

          <p>This was a project that we worked on in which we used Angular to connect to the server and database created by the Back-end students on our team.  This was my first ever Hackathon.  It started Friday evening at the end of week eight and continued all the way to Sunday afternoon.  At that time we gave our sales pitch for our project to our instructors and volunteers from the Codesmith team.  While overcoming a short time limit and very little sleep, we managed to put together a MVP application to help people who have roommates split the rent and utility bills with as little effort as possible.</p>

          <p>This was our final group project.  During this time with the help of another Front-end Engineer and a Rails Developer, we put together an application for meeting friends based on the matching of simple words.  We decided to use Angular for this project.  Although I had used it in the past, it was amazing to learn Angular not only through lectures, but also by simply discovering something that we wanted our app to do and finding a way to make it possible.  This was done through Angular or sometimes simply just writing some basic Vanilla JavaScript.  Presenting this project at Demo Day and seeing people truly interested in what you made was something I will never forget.  With this project I also built a new level of confidence in my ability to teach myself any of the necessary skills to pursue this career</p>
